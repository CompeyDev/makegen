Makegen is a dynamic Makefile configurator, inspired by the likes of GNU AutoConf. 

It makes use of a `makegen.toml` configuration file located in the current working directory where the binary is executed from. Based on 
the instructions provided in file, makegen generates a platform-specific makefile, which can then be used in combination with
GNU Make.

Furthermore, makegen follows a standardized makefile syntax, including various utilities such as a logger, variable checkers & more to come.
